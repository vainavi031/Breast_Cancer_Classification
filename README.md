# Breast_Cancer_Classification
Breast cancer arises when cells in the breast start to develop abnormally. Due to this cancer, there is a huge number of deaths every year. It is the most common type of all cancer and also the main cause of womenâ€™s death worldwide.
Nowadays Classification and data mining methods are very effective ways to classify data. Especially when we talk about the medical field, wherewith the help of machine learning we diagnose the disease and analyze it to make particular decisions.

Data set of UCI Machine Learning Repository: Attribute Information:

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3-32)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter (mean size of the core tumor)
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.

Missing attribute values: none

Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant
